00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:06,890
Welcome to MuseScore in Minutes

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,400
A series of short videos that will quickly get
you up and running with MuseScore 2.0

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,300
I'm Dr. George Hess and in each of
these videos will look at how to use

4
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:19,540
some of the basic functions of the
exciting new version of this program

5
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:23,040
MuseScore is a free and open source
music notation program,

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:26,480
that's a great alternative to Finale and Sibelius

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,300
You can download it for free
at the website shown on the screen

8
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:37,980
Lesson 9 - Repeats and Endings, Part 2

9
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,510
Now we take a look at some other types of repeats

10
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:45,739
It's pretty common,
when you have measures repeating exactly like this

11
00:00:45,739 --> 00:00:48,999
to use one measure repeat instead of writing it all out

12
00:00:48,999 --> 00:00:51,399
So I'm going to select and delete all of those measures

13
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:55,860
And I'm going to Repeats & Jumps Palettes

14
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:01,940
and drag a one bar repeat
into a rhythm section instruments

15
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:07,390
Now I select that measure, use the R key to repeat it

16
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:10,650
We can do that also in measure 6 and 8

17
00:01:11,899 --> 00:01:14,310
Now let's have a solo section

18
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:18,039
We use our rhythm section parts and so,
just copy the first 12 measures

19
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:23,980
and click in measure 15

20
00:01:25,329 --> 00:01:26,349
and paste it

21
00:01:26,899 --> 00:01:32,859
Over there is probably not a bad idea 
to put a double bar line in, to make things clear

22
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,490
Next we will fill the saxophone part with slashes

23
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,680
Go up to the Edit Menu

24
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,860
Select Tools, Fill With Slashes

25
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,660
After the solo we return to the head,
before jumping to the ending

26
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:55,930
I want to place a double bar at the end of the solo

27
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,400
And we will go to the Repeat Palette

28
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,940
and select “D.S. al Coda”
to take us back to the first measure

29
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:11,580
Then I put a Segno in measure 1

30
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,240
We jump to the coda after measure 8

31
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,230
So we'll put the “To Coda” sign there

32
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:28,000
And we haven't actually created our coda yet,
but we know where it's going to be

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,760
So let's go ahead and move down there
and we will place the Coda sign

34
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,940
at the first empty measure

35
00:02:37,799 --> 00:02:43,619
Finaly I'm going to copy a couple of measures
onto our coda

36
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:56,300
And we go ahead
and enter a couple of notes to take us out

37
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,980
One last thing we should do is copy the chord symbols
to the guitar and the bass

38
00:03:05,989 --> 00:03:13,530
Select the first chord symbol, right click
and then Select, All Similar Elements

39
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:17,409
Now that's going to cause a little bit of a problem
because of these last two

40
00:03:17,409 --> 00:03:20,029
and so I'm going to hold the Ctrl/Command key

41
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:25,079
and select those to delete them from our selection

42
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:27,199
Now I can copy and paste these

43
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:31,500
Actually I'm going to cut them from the tenor
cause I don't need them there

44
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,740
I’m going to select the first measure here

45
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:37,620
and then I select the first measure of the bass

46
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,580
and paste them in

47
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,760
and I will do the same thing

48
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,500
for all of the solo section

49
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,560
We have a couple of extra measures at the end

50
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:57,609
Let's go ahead and get rid of those

51
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:04,879
Select those and go to the Edit menu, Measure,
Delete Selected Measures

52
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,119
Now, our arrangement is all set up
