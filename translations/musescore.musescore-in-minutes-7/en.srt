00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:06,890
Welcome to MuseScore in Minutes

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,400
A series of short videos that will quickly get
you up and running with MuseScore 2.0

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,300
I'm Dr. George Hess and in each of
these videos will look at how to use

4
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:19,540
some of the basic functions of the
exciting new version of this program

5
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:23,040
MuseScore is a free and open source
music notation program,

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:26,480
that's a great alternative to Finale and Sibelius

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,300
You can download it for free
at the website shown on the screen

8
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:38,400
Lesson 7 - Tablature and Drum Notation

9
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,660
We are going to use the lead sheet now,
to create a simple arrangement

10
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:45,470
I have copied the music into a new score

11
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:49,610
Next we’ll enter the notes for the guitar,
bass and drums in the 1st measure

12
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,840
You can enter notes on either the standard staff
or the tab staff

13
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,560
And since they are linked, they show up on both staves

14
00:00:57,579 --> 00:01:01,099
To enter notes in the tab staff, click the 1st measure

15
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,000
Then enter the Note Input mode

16
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,500
Choose the note value with the mouse
You can't use the shortcut here

17
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,280
You are going to use the up and down arrow keys

18
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,079
to move to the different strings

19
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:16,139
We are going to move to the 5th string

20
00:01:16,139 --> 00:01:20,339
And then you type the fret number,
using the number keys

21
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:23,500
To advance use the right arrow

22
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:41,000
Now I'm doing this a little bit differently and notice that
I have only entered the notes on the 5th string

23
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:44,660
Now I'm going to use the arrow keys
to move to the 6th string

24
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:55,220
And then I'm going to place an E, an open note,
typing 0 on each downbeat

25
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:05,380
Next I will enter the 8th notes in the bass,
using step entry

26
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,450
Drum notation can be introduced using the keyboard
or the MIDI keyboard

27
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:21,310
Select the drum staff, then enter Note Input mode

28
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:25,220
You see the mapping of the drums
on the bottom of the screen

29
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:29,319
We will enter a simple beat with hi-hat,
snare and kick drum

30
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,700
In drum notation the hi-hat and the snare
will have the stems going up

31
00:02:33,709 --> 00:02:36,319
The base drum will have the stems going down

32
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,290
MuseScore will handle this automatically

33
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:42,000
We will enter the hi-hat first

34
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,140
Enter Note Input mode

35
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:45,980
and then select the 8th note

36
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,880
You notice then in the drum map
that the hi-hat has been assigned the shortcut G

37
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:55,700
So we can just type G and it will enter the note

38
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:00,700
You can also type any key on the MIDI keyboard

39
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:07,179
While the note is selected in the drum map,
and it will enter as well

40
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:10,599
To add the snare drum,
use the left arrow key to move to beat 2

41
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:17,739
You’ll see down in the drum map,
that the shortcut for snare drum is A

42
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:20,379
Hold the Shift key down and type A

43
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:24,560
Then move to beat 4 and do the same thing

44
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:27,620
Now for the kick drum

45
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:30,340
You notice that the kick drum note is shown in green

46
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:33,430
This means it will be entered in voice 2

47
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,310
Use the arrow key to move to beat one

48
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,440
Type 5 for quarter note

49
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,980
and then B

50
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:53,280
Now type 4 to change that to an 8th rest and 0

51
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,220
Now type B again

52
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,240
type 5

53
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,880
and then B one more time

54
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,860
So now is our basic rhythm section parts entered,
we’re ready to create the rest of our arrangement
