00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:06,890
Welcome to MuseScore in Minutes

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,400
A series of short videos that will quickly get
you up and running with MuseScore 2.0

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,300
I'm Dr. George Hess and in each of
these videos will look at how to use

4
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:19,540
some of the basic functions of the
exciting new version of this program

5
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:23,040
MuseScore is a free and open source
music notation program,

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:26,480
that's a great alternative to Finale and Sibelius

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,300
You can download it for free
at the website shown on the screen

8
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:37,860
Lesson 8 - Repeats and Endings, Part 1

9
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,360
In this lesson we will take what we've done so far

10
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,180
and create an arrangement using copy,
paste and various types of repeats

11
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:50,800
It will make it easier to follow along,
if we turn on measure numbers first

12
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,500
Go up to the Style menu

13
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,210
Select General

14
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:57,420
Then check “Header, Footer, Numbers”

15
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:04,000
and then at the bottom tick “Measure Numbers”, “Interval”, and then set it to 1

16
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:11,900
Now we fill up the rhythm section
and we will do the head

17
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:19,119
MuseScore has a very well hidden command,
that will let us copy and paste at the same time

18
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:23,580
Let's select all of my measures for the rhythm
section and if I type the key R

19
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:27,440
it copies and pastes it all in one stroke

20
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:31,189
So let us do that for all 12 measures

21
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,440
Our score is going to get a little large

22
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:40,370
And so I think it will be easier to work 
if we switch to continuous view

23
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,940
Now we use the transpose tool
to create a chord progression

24
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:52,920
Going to measure 5, I am going to select
measure 5 and 6 on the guitar and bass

25
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,560
and go up to the Notes menu and select Transpose

26
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,940
We will transpose it up by interval

27
00:01:58,949 --> 00:02:00,940
and it's going up a Perfect Fourth

28
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:13,440
At measure 9 we will do the same thing,
but we going to transpose it up a Perfect Fifth

29
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:23,180
And then we need to transpose
measure 10 and measure 12 as well

30
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,620
It's pretty common to play the head of a blues twice

31
00:02:28,629 --> 00:02:31,549
So let's go ahead and create first and second endings

32
00:02:31,549 --> 00:02:38,819
We start out by using our repeat command,
selecting measures 11 and 12 and type R

33
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,760
Next, go to the Barlines Palette

34
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,580
and select the backward repeat
and drag it to measure 12

35
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:56,740
Go back to measure one and select the forward repeat
and drag it to measure one

36
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:02,450
Now we go to the Lines Palette

37
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:07,660
I will select the first ending and drag it
to measure 11

38
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:11,289
Now I need this to extend the measure 12

39
00:03:11,289 --> 00:03:18,659
So I'm going to doubleclick and then hold
the Shift key down and press the arrow key

40
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:21,959
Don't just drag it, it won't work,
it won't play back correctly

41
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:28,400
Now we can drag the second ending to measure 13

42
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,249
We need to do just a little bit of touch up

43
00:03:31,249 --> 00:03:35,099
Our first ending should have the pickup note
added in the melody

44
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:36,730
So we go ahead and change that

45
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:52,299
And then also I'd like to go ahead
and make the sound a little bit more like a turnaround

46
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:57,359
by putting a rest on the downbeat
on the guitar and the bass

47
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,940
Just click on those and type 0
