Welcome to MuseScore in Minutes. 

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,400
A series of short videos that will quickly get
you up and running with MuseScore 2.0

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,300
I'm Dr. George Hess and in each of 
these videos will look at how to use

4
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:19,540
some of the basic functions of the 
exciting new version of this program.

5
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:23,040
MuseScore is a free and open source
music notation program,

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:26,480
that's a great alternative to Finale and Sibelius

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,300
You can download it for free
at the website shown on the screen.

00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,840
Lesson 5 - More Input Ideas

9
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,860
We’ve already looked at ways to enter notes
using the mouse, keyboard, and a midi keyboard

10
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:46,889
But there are even better ways
to get notes into MuseScore

11
00:00:46,889 --> 00:00:50,559
In this video we are looking some ways
to finish our melody very quickly

12
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:53,309
Let's start by taking a look at the entire melody

13
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:57,449
If you look closely, you notice that the rhythm
of the first and second phrases are identical

14
00:00:57,449 --> 00:00:59,129
but the pitches change

15
00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:02,949
You also see that first half of the third phrase
has the same rhythm

16
00:01:02,949 --> 00:01:06,180
We start by using copy and paste

17
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:11,020
First we need to break up the rest,
to make beat 4 visible in measure 4

18
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:15,770
Let's click on that whole rest, type a 6
to break it in a half notes

19
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:20,060
and then select a 2nd one and type 5
to turn it into quarter notes

20
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,720
I usually like to zoom in
when I'm doing selecting work

21
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:27,049
So I'm going ahead and zoom in to 150%

22
00:01:27,049 --> 00:01:29,849
And now, what I want to do is
to select this phrase and copy it

23
00:01:29,849 --> 00:01:33,240
So click on the pickup measure

24
00:01:33,249 --> 00:01:37,309
hold the shift key down and select all that measure

25
00:01:37,309 --> 00:01:42,249
Now type Cmd+C or Ctrl+C to copy it

26
00:01:42,249 --> 00:01:46,640
Click on that last quarter rest
and then Cmd+V or Ctrl+V to paste it

27
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,560
We are going to to the same thing in measure 8

28
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,860
So now, we have 3 identical phrases

29
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:03,220
If this were a Riff-Blues, we'd be done

30
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:08,280
But we still have to change the notes
To do this, we use the repitching tool

31
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:13,900
Click the 1st note of the 2nd phrase
Type N to enter note input mode

32
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:18,760
and then click the repitch tool right next to it

33
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:24,920
Now play the correct pitches for phrase 2
and the first half of phrase 3

34
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,560
Don't chose any note values

35
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:39,679
When finished, click the repitch tool again
to return to input mode

36
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,850
The melody ends with a measure of triplets
Let's enter those now

37
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:48,491
If you are still in note input mode,
press the Esc key

38
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:53,920
And then select measure 11, hold the shift key
and select measure 12

39
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,920
Press the Backspace key to delete the notes

40
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,860
Click the whole rest

41
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:06,240
Now enter input mode again and type 6

42
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,860
then type Cmd+3 for a triplet

43
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:13,380
And you'll see, that we have now a quarter note triplet

44
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,100
Play the notes

45
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,440
Right now, we have to do Cmd+3 again
for the next triplet

46
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,140
Press 6 first

47
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:37,040
And then our last note, the whole note

48
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:42,080
There is one more very important method of
inputting music in MuseScore I need to mention

49
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,080
Importing

50
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:47,260
MuseScore has long supported the import and export

51
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:50,200
of more file formats than any other program

52
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,560
The list of supported formats is shown on the screen

53
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,750
There are thousands of these files
available for free in the internet

54
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:01,250
The results you get from importing each type
of those files will vary greatly

55
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,090
Some will be almost ready to use

56
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:06,439
and some need so much work
that it's pretty much useless

57
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:12,739
In general MusicXML files will provide the
best results that require the least amount of editing

58
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:15,989
But there are usable files in all formats
