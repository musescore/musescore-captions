00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:06,890
Welcome to MuseScore in Minutes

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,400
A series of short videos that will quickly get
you up and running with MuseScore 2.0

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,300
I'm Dr. George Hess and in each of 
these videos will look at how to use

4
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:19,540
some of the basic functions of the 
exciting new version of this program

5
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:23,040
MuseScore is a free and open source
music notation program,

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:26,480
that's a great alternative to Finale and Sibelius

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,300
You can download it for free
at the website shown on the screen

8
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,880
Lesson 6 - Text, Lyrics and Chords

9
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,740
Next we need to add chords and lyrics to our melody

10
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:46,320
In the course of writing the lyrics,
I decided to change the title

11
00:00:46,329 --> 00:00:48,940
So let's double click

12
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:56,780
I'm going to change that from
"Blues for a while" to "Blues for Muse(Score)"

13
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:58,620
Now let's enter the lyrics

14
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,339
Lyrics are attached to notes

15
00:01:01,339 --> 00:01:05,139
I'm going to zoom in just a bit to make it easier

16
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:10,780
Select the first note,
and then right click underneath it

17
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:15,600
Select the text submenu 
and you see there lyrics down at the bottom

18
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,720
Notice the shortcut Cmd + L / Ctrl + L

19
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,420
While we are at it, you should notice the
shortcut for the chord symbol

20
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,579
We'll use that a little bit later

21
00:01:23,579 --> 00:01:26,119
So now select lyrics

22
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:29,260
Type the first word 'I'

23
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:31,720
Then press the spacebar to move to the next note

24
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:36,920
We continue to enter the next couple of notes

25
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:43,689
The word 'blues' extends into the next note,
the tied note

26
00:01:43,899 --> 00:01:51,710
So to move to that, we are going to put an
extension and that is Shift + Dash or Underscore

27
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:55,259
We do it once and then we do it one more time
for the note that we are extending to

28
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:58,219
And that will take us to the next note

29
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:01,600
We are continuing entering the rest of the phrase

30
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:03,740
In the same way

31
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,940
Now 'MuseScore' is a two syllable word

32
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:11,390
To move to the next note use the Dash key

33
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,540
And again we need our extension here

34
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:28,060
So press Shift + Underscore twice

35
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,940
The second phrase is the same as the first

36
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:35,160
And as with notes, copy and paste is faster

37
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:43,400
Select any of the lyrics, and then right click
to select all similar elements

38
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,700
Now everything is selected

39
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,920
Type Cmd or Ctrl + C to copy it

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,810
Click the first note of the second phrase
and then type Cmd or Ctrl + V to paste it

41
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,020
Now click the first note of the last phrase

42
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:04,160
Type Cmd+L again and enter the rest of the lyrics

43
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,760
Chord Symbols are entered in much the same way

44
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:31,240
Click the first note of the first measure

45
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,200
And remember our shortcut Cmd + K

46
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,240
And we can enter our chord

47
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:43,940
We can then click the first note
of the fourth measure

48
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:47,260
use the shortcut again and type that in

49
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,960
And right here we also do the same thing

50
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,380
You can also use the spacebar to advance

51
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:22,020
The last chord is a turnaround chord
so we'll put that in parenthesis

52
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:30,040
You'll notice that MuseScore has done
a pretty good job in fixing the layout already

53
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,520
Let's go ahead and delete this last measure

54
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:39,320
Go up to the edit menu, select measure,
delete selected measures

55
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,640
The backspace key won't work here

56
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:48,680
Now that's perfect, we've got four measures
on each line and our lead sheet is done
