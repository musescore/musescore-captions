00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:06,890
Welcome to MuseScore in Minutes

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,400
A series of short videos that will quickly get
you up and running with MuseScore 2.0

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,300
I'm Dr. George Hess and in each of
these videos will look at how to use

4
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:19,540
some of the basic functions of the
exciting new version of this program

5
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:23,040
MuseScore is a free and open source
music notation program,

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:26,480
that's a great alternative to Finale and Sibelius

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,300
You can download it for free
at the website shown on the screen

00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,200
Lesson 10 - Articulations, Dynamics and Text

9
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:45,220
With all of the notes and chords entered,
we can now turn our attention to express the details

10
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:47,090
All of these entries come from the palette

11
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,880
There are few also found in the Add menu as well

12
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,640
Some also have shortcuts assigned

13
00:00:54,739 --> 00:00:57,380
The pallete entries are attached to notes

14
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:00,640
Select the note first
and double-click the item in the pallete

15
00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:04,049
Let's start by entering some dynamics at the beginning

16
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,720
You can adjust the dynamics by dragging them

17
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:31,700
But it's usually better to go over here
and use the inspector and use the offsets

18
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,320
Staccato is one of the articulations,
that has a shortcut assigned

19
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:44,030
Click on a note and type Shift+S

20
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,060
it's a toggle so if you type Shift+S again, it'll be removed

21
00:01:49,999 --> 00:01:53,639
You can assign more than one articulation to a note

22
00:01:53,639 --> 00:01:59,459
Put the staccato back and go over here,
to the Articulations & Ornaments palette

23
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:05,130
and while that note is still selected,
I'll double-click the accent and it will place it there too

24
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,920
Fermatas are also in the articulations palette

25
00:02:10,929 --> 00:02:14,909
We can enter them into all staves at once
by selecting the notes

26
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,120
and then double-clicking the fermata

27
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:24,020
You see that there is an extra one 
because we have two voices in the drums

28
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:26,350
Just click on that and delete it

29
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:30,720
While we are here, let's go ahead
and add a role to the last symbol

30
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:35,080
Select a note, select the Tremolo

31
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:38,640
Double-click

32
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:41,750
And let's add an arpeggio to this chord

33
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:52,620
I'd also like to add a decrescendo right here
on this very last line

34
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:56,500
And it's a line, so I select the palette, double-click it

35
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,280
and then use Shift+Right to extend it
to the end of the line

36
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:09,870
Slurs are also in the Line palette
and are entered in the same way

37
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:18,819
Double-click and then use the right arrow key
to extend it to the end of the line

38
00:03:18,819 --> 00:03:23,719
You notice that there are handles here 
and this will let you adjust the ark

39
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:32,780
A various types of text can be entered from the palette,
the Add menu or using a shortcut

40
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,260
One special text entry is Swing

41
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:40,340
Enter it the same way you enter other items
from the palette

42
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,540
Whatâ€™s next is special, is the effects playback

43
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,400
Now let's add a tempo marking

44
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,400
Select the Tempo palette

45
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:58,140
Select the first note and double-click a tempo

46
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:06,880
and now we can double-click it to edit it

47
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,080
We don't actually want to see that,
it's going to be too cluttered

48
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,780
so we just click the visible button in the inspector

49
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:17,999
and it will not print out

50
00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:21,479
Finally let's add a rehearsal mark

51
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,980
At the beginning of the solo, select the first note

52
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:29,260
and we use the shortcut Cmd/Ctrl-M
for the rehearsal mark

53
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:34,560
and then type B for our letter

54
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,560
So now all of the entries are done
and the score is almost complete

55
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:43,400
In the next lesson we make it fill in the page nicely
and take a look at the parts
