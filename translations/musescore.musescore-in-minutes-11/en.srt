00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:06,890
Welcome to MuseScore in Minutes

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,400
A series of short videos that will quickly get
you up and running with MuseScore 2.0

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,300
I'm Dr. George Hess and in each of
these videos will look at how to use

4
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:19,540
some of the basic functions of the
exciting new version of this program

5
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:23,040
MuseScore is a free and open source
music notation program,

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:26,480
that's a great alternative to Finale and Sibelius

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,300
You can download it for free
at the website shown on the screen

8
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:38,040
Lesson 11: Layout and Parts

9
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:42,300
With everything entered,
we can now turn our attention to the layout

10
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,900
Let's start by setting the view to one or two pages,
depending on your screen size

11
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,900
You can see we have a number of problems

12
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:56,520
The systems are not centered on the page

13
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,300
Our chord symbols are overlapping the stems here

14
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:06,660
The first ending is split between two systems,
that is usually not a good idea

15
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,460
And then we have
the dreaded hanging system at the end

16
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,960
Let's start with the chord symbols

17
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,960
They are little to far away from the staff

18
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,220
We can adjust that globally

19
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:24,020
Go up to the Style menu, select General

20
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:32,100
Chord Symbols, and then reduce
the default vertical position to one and a half spaces

21
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:35,450
Click Apply, then OK

22
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,220
That solved some of the problems

23
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:43,030
But there is still not enough space 
between the base and the tab-staff

24
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:46,890
We could increase that globally too,
but then it would affect all staves

25
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:50,580
Since we only need to increase the space
between those two staves

26
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:53,540
we use the tools in the Breaks & Spacers palette

27
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:01,400
There are two spacers tools:
one for up and one for down

28
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:05,960
Select the spacer up
and then drag it into the middle of the staff

29
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:10,080
They will automatically increase the space

30
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:11,870
You have to do it for each system

31
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,520
If you need more space, double click on the spacer

32
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:25,600
Click on the handle and drag it up or down

33
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:31,840
The next step is to reduce the size of the notation

34
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,500
That should solve a lot of the other problems

35
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,000
Select page settings from the Layout menu

36
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:44,960
and reduce the scaling
until you see three systems on the first page

37
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:50,260
Now, while we are here, let's go ahead
and increase the page margins

38
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:56,300
Let's do the odd page first, page 1,
and increase that to 15

39
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:00,240
and on the even page, page 2, we are going
to increase it to 25

40
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,100
Click OK

41
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:10,320
And you can see that most of our problems
have been taken care of

42
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:13,120
But it would be better if it used all of both pages

43
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,360
Let's start by moving the coda to a new system

44
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,280
In the breaks and spacers palette

45
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,780
Click on the system break tool

46
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,520
and drag it to the measure right before the coda

47
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,320
Now use the same tool to move measures around

48
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:34,400
So that we have the melody on one page
and the solo on the second page

49
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,300
And then balance it out

50
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,120
It's common to invent a coda

51
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,300
Select the first measure of the coda

52
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:54,800
Go up to the Add menu, select Frames,
Insert Horizontal Frame

53
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,120
A last step in layout is to look it over carefully
for any overlapping entries

54
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,680
or other things that should be adjusted

55
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,040
The title and the composer need to be moved

56
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:10,780
We click on the that, use the horizontal offset

57
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,600
Center it

58
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:21,600
Move it up a little bit
or move the composer down a little bit

59
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,340
Now zoom in and scan the score

60
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:34,240
Don't worry about any of the non-printing characters
like spacers or page breaks

61
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,220
To create parts, select Parts from the File menu

62
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,920
Click New All and then OK

63
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,480
You have a separate tab now for each part

64
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,060
The parts are dynamically linked to the score

65
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:11,700
Any changes to entries on the part
will be reflected in the score and vice-versa

66
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,140
And the layout including the offset is independent

67
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:19,540
Parts will be saved automatically,
when you save your file too

68
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,380
This is the last video
in the introductory series on MuseScore 2.0

69
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:30,240
I hope you have enjoyed it
and now you are on your way to be a power user

70
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,400
We still be posting tips and tricks along
the way so we hope to see you again soon
